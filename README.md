**What**: With a few basic scientific computing and communication skills, scientists 
and engineers can get more done in less time and with less pain. The goal of this workshop 
is to help you be more effective in your graduate coursework (open-ended projects, 
in-class presentations, group work) and extracurricular opportunities (internships, 
research assistantships, and eventually full-time employment) by introducing you to 
some of those skills.

**How**: In this two-day workshop, short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises.

**Requirements**: Before the workshop,

* Register for free on Eventbrite, using your NYU email address.
* Create an account on GitHub if you don't already have one: https://github.com/
* Create an account on ShareLaTeX: https://www.sharelatex.com
* If the laptop you will work on is running Windows, download and install Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads

On the day of the workshop,

* Bring your own laptop to work on (and laptop charger). You can't attend the workshop without your own laptop.

**Content**: The syllabus for this short course will include (time permitting):

* using the Linux shell to do more in less time
* using version control (git) to back up and version your work
* basic data analysis with Python
* crafting a message to convey the value of your work
* preparing slides that make your presentations more effective
* using LaTeX to prepare publication-quality reports
