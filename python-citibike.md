# Python Citi Bike assignment

If you need help at any time, put your *red* sticky note on the back of your 
laptop. If you finish, you can put your *green* sticky note on the back of your
laptop, then try to ask and answer _another_ question.

## Your task

We will now undertake a significant independent project. Your task is to:

* Define an interesting question that one might ask and answer based on the 
Citi Bike data set.
* Use either the Message Box or the story arc approach to explain your project.
Write a short paragraph based on your Message Box or story arc, and include
it in the README file that's in the Github repository you created at 
the beginning of today's session.
* Write Python code to find the answer to the question that you posed.
* Commit your Python code to the Github repository you created at the beginning
of today's session.
* In your README, explain what the answer to your question was, and 
how you found it.

Of course, the instructors are here to help you as you work on this significant, 
open-ended project :)


Some potential questions you might ask are listed on the back of this page, 
but you're not in any way limited to those!

The `matplotlib` library is often used to plot or visualize results in Python.
If you want to create a visual answer to your question, please refer to the 
`matplotlib` documentation.

## Potential questions

* Which stations are trending up in popularity? Which are trending down? (You might want to look at more than 2016 for this)
* Which stations are the least balanced (more bikes leaving than entering, or vice versa)?
* Which stations support the youngest bikers? The oldest? (
* Which are the starting stations that start bikers off on the longest trips (in terms of trip duration)?
* What are the most popular start-end station pairs?
* What is the most popular hour of the day to start a trip on weekdays? Weekends? 
* Which stations serve mostly annual subscribers, and which are more likely to serve tourists? 

Some more advanced questions you may want to answer if you've already finished
one of the questions above:

* Using the `networkx` library, can you visualize the Citi Bike network as a directed graph, with the edge weight of each link giving the number of trips on that path?
* Can you find and download Central Park precipitation data, and find the 
relationship between Citi Bike usage and temperature/precipitation? 
* What stations are more popular during rush hour, and what stations have more even demand throughout the day?
* Using the `networkx` library: find the most used bike in the system (by duration), and show its trips as a directed graph. How often is the bike moved manually?
