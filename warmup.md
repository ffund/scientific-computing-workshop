# Warmup

If you need help at any time, put your **red** sticky note on the back of your 
laptop. When you've finished, , put your **green** sticky note on the back of your laptop. 

Late today we will continue working with the Citi Bike data set. While previously
we looked at one basic feature of the data (the most popular station), today 
we will use Python to take a closer look.

In preparation for today's lesson,

* Create a new Github repository. You will keep the code from today's 
mini project on the Citi Bike data, and your explanation of your mini project, 
in it. Give your repository an appropriate title related to the contents of the 
repository, i.e. reference Citi Bike in the title.
* SSH into our server at `server.camp.ch-geni-net.instageni.nysernet.org` 
using your net ID as your username, as in 

```                                                                             
ssh ff524@server.camp.ch-geni-net.instageni.nysernet.org                        
```                                                                             

and the following password:     

```                                                                             
BOOK-FINISHED-WONDER-lost                                                       
```

* Clone a copy of your new repository into your home directory on our server.
* Last week, you worked on a Bash script that manipulates the Citi Bike data 
files from https://witestlab.poly.edu/bikes/. Add this Bash script to your 
git repository, commit your changes, and push to Github.

For this week's exercises, which are more computing intensive, we
have set up additional servers with more computing resources. These are at

```
server.camp.ch-geni-net.genirack.nyu.edu
```

and

```
server.camp.ch-geni-net.instageni.northwestern.edu
```

and you can log in to them with the same username and password as the original server.

Choose one of the two new servers, and SSH into that server.
On the new server, clone a copy of your Citi Bike repository.     
Then, use `cd` and `cat` to inspect the contents of your local working copy of your
repository.
